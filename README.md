# 📚 Computer Science Study Notes - Ultralearning Journey 

Welcome to my **Computer Science Study Notes** repository! This repository documents my **self-directed ultralearning journey** in Computer Science, inspired by Scott H. Young's **Metalearning Framework**.

Rather than following a traditional degree path, I am structuring my learning using the **WHY, WHAT, HOW** framework, breaking down concepts for **deep understanding and retention**.

This repository will expand over time as I study different courses and resources.

## 🧠 How These Notes Are Structured  

Each folder represents a **different learning resource** I’m using (e.g., CS50P, books, courses, etc.). Inside each folder, you’ll find **Metalearning Notes** that break down the topic using the **WHY, WHAT, HOW framework**:

### 🔍 **WHY** – The Purpose of Learning  
- Why does this topic matter?  
- What real-world problems does it solve?  
- Where is it used in industry?  

### 📖 **WHAT** – The Core Concepts  
- Key ideas, definitions, and principles  
- Important functions, algorithms, or theories  
- Common pitfalls or misconceptions  

### 🛠️ **HOW** – The Application  
- Code examples and practical exercises  
- Hands-on projects and problem-solving  
- Debugging techniques and optimization

## 📂 Repository Structure

Currently, I am focusing on **CS50's Introduction to programming with Python (CS50P)**. More folders will be added as I explore new topics.

```
/computer-science-study-notes
    |--- README.md (this file)
    |--- CS50P/ (Notes and exercises from Harvard's CS50P course)
         |--- Week_0
         |--- Week_1
         |--- Week_2
         |--- ...
    |--- (More folders to be added as I progress)
```

Future additions may include:
- **Books** (Summaries and insights from Computer Science books)
- **Courses** (Metalearning Notes from other courses)

## 🚀 How to Learn from These Notes

1️⃣ **Follow the Metalearning Notes** - Start with the WHY, then understand WHAT, and practice the HOW.
2️⃣ **Apply the Feynman Technique** - Try explaining concepts in your own words to check your understanding.
3️⃣ **Experiment with Code** - Don't just read-**write and modify code** to see how it works.
4️⃣ **Build Projects** - Apply what you learn by creating small projects along the way.
5️⃣ **Iterate & Expand** - Keep refining and adding to your knowledge over time.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

- **Self-taught learners** navigating Computer Science independently
- **CS students** looking for structured study notes
- **Developers** seeking deep understanding and retention
- **Anyone pursuing Ultralearning in CS (like me!)**
