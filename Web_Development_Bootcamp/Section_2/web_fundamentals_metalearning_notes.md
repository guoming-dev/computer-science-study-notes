# 📘 Metalearning Notes - Section 2: Web Basics

## 🎯 Purpose (Why learn this?)

To build anything on the web, from personal blog to a SaaS product, you must understand the environment your code will run in: the internet. Knowing how the web works helps you debug better, optimize performance, and talk to APIs. It's the foundation beneath all frontend and backend skills.

## 🧠 Concept Breakdown (What to learn?)

### 1. How The Internet Works 🌐

> "The internet is like a global postal service for digital information."

- **Definition**: A global network of computers that share information using standardized communication protocols. (TCP/IP).
- **Key Concepts**
  - Devices are connected through **ISPs (Internet Service Providers)**.
  - Every device has an **IP address**, like your home's address.
  - **DNS (Domain Name System)** translates website names (like google.com) into IP addresses.
  - Data travels in **packets** using a system of routers and switches.

🧪 **Feynman Explanation**: Imagine mailing a letter to a friend - you write their address, a post office routes it, and your friend receives it. The internet does the same, but with computers and data packets.

### 2. HTTP Request/Response Cycle 🔁

> "When you visit a site, it's like placing an order at a restaurant. You ask (request), the server cooks (processes), and you get your food (response)."

- **Request**: You type `example.com` in your browser → a request is sent to that server.
- **Response**: The server sends back HTML, CSS, and JS files.
- **Key Players**:
  - **Client**: Your browser
  - **Server**: The computer hosting the website
  - **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**: Rules for communication
  - **Status Codes**: 200 → OK, 400 → Not Found, etc.

🧪 **Feynman Explanation**: Think of it like ordering food. You ask the waiter (browser) for a dish (website), he takes the order to the chef (server), and brings the meal (HTML/CSS/JS) back.

### 3. Intro to the Web 🌍

> "The web is the software layer of the internet that lets us view and interact with sites."

- **The Web vs The Internet**:
  - Internet = hardware (wires, routers, protocols)
  - Web = software built on top (websites, browsers, HTML)
- The browser (Chrome, Firefox) is your window to the web.
- Everything you see on a webpage is built using HTML, styles with CSS, and powered by JavaScript.
  
🧪 **Feynman Explanation**: If the internet is the road system, then the web is like the bustling city built on top of it - with shops, homes, traffic, and all the action we interact with daily.

### 4. HTML, CSS, JS: The Trio of the Web 💻

> "Websites are made of structure (HTML), style (CSS), and behavior (JS)."

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: The skeleton. It tells the browser what things are (headings, paragraphs, images).
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: The skin and clothes. It makes things look good (colors, layout, fonts).
- **JavaScript**: The brain and movement. It makes things interactive (click buttons, animations, forms).

## 🧰 Strategy + Method (How to learn?)

|Principles|Applied To|
|----------|----------|
|Direct Practice|Rebuild simple websites using just HTML/CSS first, then add JS.|
|Drill|Focus on just DNS and HTTP codes for a day to master core mechanisms.
|Retrieval|Use flashcards: "What's the role of DNS?" or "What happens after you hit enter in the browser?"|
|Overlearning|Re-explain these topics by writing a blog post or teaching others|
|Feedback|Use DevTools to check real HTTP requests and responses.|
