# 📌 CS50P - Introduction to Programming with Python

This folder contains my **study notes, solutions to the problem sets, and insights** from **Harvard's CS50P (Introduction to Programming with Python)**.

Each week's material is structured using the **Metalearning Framework (WHY, WHAT, HOW)** to reinforce deep understanding.

**📚 Course Structure**:
```markdown
/CS50P
    |--- README.md (this file)
    |--- Week_0/
         |--- code/ (problem sets solutions)
         |--- notes/ (metalearning notes for each week lecture)
    |--- Week_1
    |--- Week_2
    |--- ...
```

## 📖 How to Use These Notes:

- ✅ Follow the **Metalearning Notes** before starting each topic.
- ✅ Apply the **Feynman Technique** by explaining concepts in your own words.
- ✅ Write and modify code for **hands-on learning**.
- ✅ Build small **mini-projects** to reinforce concepts.
