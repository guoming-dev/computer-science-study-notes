# Step 1: Define the speed of light constant
c = 3 * 10**8  # Speed of light in meters per second

# Step 2: Get user input for mass
mass = int(input("Enter the mass (in kilograms): "))

# Step 3: Calculate energy
energy = mass * c**2

# Step 4: Display the result
print(f"The energy equivalent is {energy}.")
