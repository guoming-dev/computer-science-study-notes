# ⌨️ Basic Git Commands

## 🧠 WHY Learn This?

Git is the backbone of modern software development. 🛠️ It enables developers to efficiently track changes, collaborate on projects, and maintain a clean history of their work. Understanding the basics ensures you can confidently manage your codebase, recover from mistakes, and contribute to collaborative projects with ease. 💡

## 📌 WHAT You Need to Learn

Here are the essential Git commands every beginner needs to know:

### 1. 🛠️ Setting Up a Repository:
- `git init`: 🗂️ Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone <repository_url>`: 📥 Clone an existing repository to your local machine.

### 2. 🔍 Tracking Changes:
- `git status`: 📋 Check the status of your working directory.
- `git add <file_name>` / `git add .`: ➕ Stage files for the next commit.

### 3. 📜 Viewing and Comparing Changes:
- `git log`: 📖 View the history of commits.
- `git diff`: 🔄 Compare differences between your working directory and staging area.

### 4. 🌎 Syncing with Remote Repositories:
- `git remote add origin <repository_url>`: 🌐 Link your local repository to a remote.
- `git push -u origin main` / `git push origin main`: 🚀 Upload your commits to the remote repository.
- `git pull origin main`: ⬇️ Fetch and integrate changes from the remote repository.

### 5. 🧹 Cleanup and Reverting:
- `git reset <file_name>`: ♻️ Unstage files.
- `git revert <commit_hash>`: ⏮️ Undo changes from a previous commit by creating a new one.
